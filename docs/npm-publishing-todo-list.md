NPM Publishing Todo List

  Here's your complete publishing checklist:

  🔐 Pre-Publishing Setup

  1. Verify NPM account and scope access - Check login status and permissions
  2. Check @vpursuit scope availability/ownership - Ensure you can publish to this scope
  3. Pre-publish validation and testing - Run all tests and verify functionality

  📦 Package Preparation

  4. Review package.json metadata and version - Verify description, keywords, author, license
  5. Build final production package - Run npm run build:package
  6. Test package locally before publishing - Test with npx ./package.tgz

  🚀 Publishing Process

  7. Publish to NPM registry - Execute npm publish dist/
  8. Post-publish verification and testing - Test npx @vpursuit/swipl-mcp-server
  9. Update documentation with published package info - Update README with real NPM package

  ⚠️ Key Pitfalls to Watch Out For:

  - Scope ownership: Make sure you own/can access the @vpursuit scope
  - Version conflicts: Check if version 1.0.0 already exists
  - Missing shebang: Our build script handles this (already fixed)
  - Wrong publish directory: Always publish from dist/ not root
  - File permissions: Ensure binary is executable (handled by build script)
  - Dependencies: Verify only production deps are included
